Perlin Noise is a type of random noise that is designed to be smooth: random vectors are assigned at specific points across the input range and are interpolated between smoothly.

By increasing the number of dimensions the Perlin Noise takes as inputs, a time-dependent Perlin Noise field can be generated.

We can use this field as a force acting on a set of particles, which trace their paths in varying colours over time. This process can create nice graphics, and created all background images on https://dannybold.xyz/.

This project creates these graphics, and includes a real time demonstration in the file test2.py.
